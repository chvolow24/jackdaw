This is an informal document tracking jackdaw version updates. 


v0.6.0 (Wed May 21 15:24:21 MDT 2025)
	- dynamic track effects chains
		- S-e to add effects to track; no effects by default
		- put effects in any order by reordering tabs in tab view
		- delete effects
		- multiple effects per type
	- automations + API tree
		- automations can be added for any endpoint registered to the track's API node
		- de-registering an API node (e.g. deleting an effect) removes it related automations
	- automations for boolean values (e.g. Effect active)
	- parametric EQ effect
		- direct form I IIR implementation (direct form II to be implemented later as optimization)
		- peak/notch filters from Reiss 2011 (full citation in readme)
		- high-shelf / low-shelf based on continuous-time Butterworth
	- saturation effect (simple sample-wise wave-shaping)
	- compressor effect
	- waveform draw optimization (hard limit waveform draw time per frame)
	- bug fixes in autocompletion, clipref name serialization,
	- basic audio signal routing (not accessible to user)
	- linear interpolation for playspeed != 1.0
	- trivial DSP optimizations
	- .jdaw version 00.17


v0.5.1
	- function lookup (autocomplete dropdown, bound to <spc>)
	- split  stereo clip to mono
	- significant refactor or TextLines to simplify interface
	- filter_set_IR function for arbitrary IR (currently inaccessible)

v0.5.0
	- click tracks, click track settings, metronomes, etc.
	- stack of track *layout*, not tracks (to accommodate click tracks)
	- loop playback
	- scroll playhead (bracket keys)
	- scrubbing
	- endpoints / concurrency model
	- API / UDP server
	- loading screens (for file I/O)
	- log-scaled frequency spectrum amplitudes
	- "Animation" interface for label and button presses (no extra GUI threads, labels disappear after an appropriate interval)
	- deferred draw operations (for labels, e.g.)
	- component refactor (sliders and radio buttons bind to endpoints)
	- layout program bug fixes
	- changes to the input mode sieve; no fallthrough for text edit mode
	- .jdaw filespec v00.15
	- integer serialization handling endianness
	- correct float serialization

----
v0.4.3 (Tue Dec 10 15:27:38 EST 2024)
	- store ALL layout dimension values as floats, never ints
	- (int dimensions causes aliasing problems in text rendering on high-DPI displays, when text dimensions were an odd value in pixels)
	- add "escape"/"dismiss" options for tabview and modal modes
	- handle error cutting when no clip at cursor

v0.4.2 (Sun Dec  1 10:15:42 EST 2024)
	- grab clips in markes range (S-g)
	- bring clip at rear to front (S-z)
	- move to next/prev clip boundary (S-l, S-j)
	- update timeline display on any playhead jump
	- don't rely on global "proj" obj for effect loads
	- clip delay line amp values
	- cut top clip only
	- refine play speed scroll adj (use preciseY)
	- fix deadlock in playback (esp. on proj destroy)
	- fix scroll layout state management

v0.4.1 (Fri Nov 29 21:48:08 EST 2024)
	- add clipref copy/paste functionality (undocumented)
	- allow 2048 cliprefs per track
	- allow 2048 cliprefs per clip
	- update .jdaw filespec to version 00.14 to account for new uint_16s

v0.4.0 (...)
